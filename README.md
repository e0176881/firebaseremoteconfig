Upating Android Apps Outside of Google Play

The main issue with Google play store updates is the fact that the store takes its own time for updates. To explain further, once the latest application has been uploaded to the store, it lines up all the existing users in a queue and then starts pushing the updates to the users, one by one. Thus, if the number of users are more, it takes more time. If at all, the new application has to reach all the users immediately, then we may have to handle the update programmatically by leaving Google Play store's auto -update functionality.
Another advantage is that the application is limited to certain community and require privacy. Hence it would be better to maintain the application update via its own server
